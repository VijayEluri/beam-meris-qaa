<h1>Quasi-Analytical Processor</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This processor is used to derive absorption and backscattering
coefficients of MERIS L2 images.&nbsp; Only pixels that are determined
to be water are processed, other pixels (land, clouds) will be assigned
a "No Data" vlaue on all bands.&nbsp; The L2_Flag band is used to
determine if a pixel is water, land or cloud.&nbsp; Any flag band value
below the cloud threshold (4194304) is considered to be water.&nbsp;
Also, only bands that are under 650nm are used in the Quasi-Analytical
Algorithm. Using the default MERIS band wavelengths, the first 6 bands
are used in processing.</p>
<h2>Flag Bands</h2>
<p>There are two flag bands in the output product of the
Quasi-Analytical Processor.&nbsp; The flag band titled l2_flags is the
flag band simply copied over from the input L2 Product.&nbsp; The flag
band titled analytical_flags contains Quasi-Analytical Processor specific
flags.</p>
<p>The values of the flag band do not contain any information
besides to specify which flag(s) that location should have marked.&nbsp;
The meaning of Quasi-Analytical Processor specific flags are as follows:
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Name</td><td>Value</td><td>Description</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>nomral</td><td>1</td><td>A valid water pixel.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Imaginary number</td><td>2</td><td>Classified as water, but an imaginary number would have been produced.</td>
	</tr>	
	<tr>
		<td>Negative Adg</td><td>4</td><td>Classified as water, but one or more of the bands contain a negative Adg value.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>non-water</td><td>8</td><td>Not classified as a water pixel (land/cloud).</td>
	</tr>
</table></p>
<p>Terrain classification (land, cloud, water) is based off of the l2_flags band.</p>
