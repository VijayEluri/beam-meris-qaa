<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>This processor is used to derive absorption and backscattering coefficients for open ocean and coastal waters of MERIS images. The Quasi Analytical
    Algorithm (QAA) has been originally developed by <i>Lee at al</i>. It is based on remote-sensing reflectances models and
    uses therefor MERIS Level 2 data as input. <br>
    An valid pixel expression is used to determine which pixels are processed. This expression is set by default to <i>'l2_flags.WATER'</i>. This
    means
    that only pixels determined as water are processed, other pixels (land, clouds) will be assigned a No-Data value (NaN) to all bands.
    Also, only bands below 670nm are used in the processing. In the case of MERIS band settings, the first 7 bands are used in the processing.<br>
    Besides MERIS Level 2 data it is also possible to process atmospherically corrected MERIS Level 1 data.
    It is only required that the reflectance bands follow the same name pattern as in MERIS L2. The expression to
    detect valid pixels can be changed as necessary for the specific product.</p>

<h3>Coefficient Bands</h3>

<p>The following absorption and backscattering coefficients are generated at different wavelengths:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>a_total</b> - The total absorption coefficient of all water constituents is given for the wavelengths at 412, 443, 490, 510 and 560.</li>
    <li><b>bb_spm</b> - The backscattering of suspended particulate matter is given for the wavelengths at 412, 443, 490, 510 and 560.</li>
    <li><b>a_pig</b> - The pigment absorption coefficient is given for the wavelengths at 412, 443 and 490.</li>
    <li><b>a_ys</b> - The yellow substance absorption coefficient is given for the wavelengths at 412, 443 and 490.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Flag Band</h3>

<p>The Quasi-Analytical Processor provides a flag band with the result product. It is named <i>'analytical_flags'</i> and contains
    flags specific for the Quasi-Analytical Processor..</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>normal</b> - Valid water pixels.</li>
    <li><b>imaginary_number</b> - Pixels that are classified as water, but an imaginary number would have been produced in step one of the algorithm.
    </li>
    <li><b>negative_a_ys</b> - Pixels that are classified as water, but one or more of the bands contain a negative <i>'a_ys'</i> value.</li>
    <li><b>non_water</b> - Pixels that are not classified as a water (land/cloud).</li>
    <li><b>a_total_oob</b> - At least one value of the <i>'a_total'</i> spectrum is out of bounds.</li>
    <li><b>bb_spm_oob</b> - At least one value of the <i>'bb_spm'</i> spectrum is out of bounds.</li>
    <li><b>a_pig_oob</b> - At least one value of the <i>'a_pig'</i> spectrum is out of bounds.</li>
    <li><b>a_ys_oob</b> - At least one value of the <i>'a_ys'</i> spectrum is out of bounds.</li>
</ul>
